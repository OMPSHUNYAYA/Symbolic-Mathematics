**Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics (SSM)** is a rigorous extension of classical arithmetic.  
Every number is represented as a pair **(m, a)** where:  
- **m** = magnitude (a standard real number)  
- **a** = alignment factor (bounded in (−1, +1))  

This alignment channel captures *stability, drift, and recovery* — turning ordinary numbers into symbolic numerals that expose hidden fragility or robustness.

## Canonical Operations (plain text)

- **Addition (⊕):**  
  (m₁, a₁) ⊕ (m₂, a₂) = (m₁ + m₂, tanh((w₁·atanh(a₁) + w₂·atanh(a₂)) / (w₁ + w₂)))

- **Subtraction (⊖):**  
  (m₁, a₁) ⊖ (m₂, a₂) = (m₁, a₁) ⊕ (−m₂, a₂)

- **Multiplication (⊗, M2 default):**  
  (m₁, a₁) ⊗ (m₂, a₂) = (m₁·m₂, tanh(atanh(a₁) + atanh(a₂)))

- **Division (⊘, M2 default):**  
  (m₁, a₁) ⊘ (m₂, a₂) = (m₁/m₂, tanh(atanh(a₁) − atanh(a₂)))

- **Identities:** additive identity = (0, +1), multiplicative identity = (1, 0)  
- **Inverses:** additive inverse = (−m, a), multiplicative inverse = (1/m, −a)

## Why This Matters

| Classical View        | Symbolic View (SSM)                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Numbers = magnitudes  | Numbers = (magnitude, alignment)                     |
| Zero = just 0         | Zero-class = {(0, a)} canonically shown as (0, +1)  |
| Inverses are classical| Inverses respect the alignment stability channel     |
| Collapse φ → ℝ        | Conservative extension: φ(m, a) = m                  |

SSM preserves all classical results under collapse, yet enriches arithmetic with a bounded alignment axis.  
This offers a new way to describe equations, theorems, and even physical laws in symbolic form.

## Impact & Benefits

**Seven case studies (Appendix C) show practical gains:**
- 🌪 **Cyclones:** earlier weakening signal vs wind-only ranking
- ❤️ **ECG:** ~18–22% earlier anomaly visibility than entropy/variance
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity:** clean flip to negative strength at attack onset
- 📈 **Annuities:** tail PV moderated smoothly with entropy-tempered weights
- 📡 **Telecom:** instability flagged one or more windows before variance
- 🔋 **Batteries:** “earned calm” detected; premature unlocks avoided
- 📊 **Audit Risk:** sharper separation of stable vs fraudulent firms

*Same math, many domains. Observational, reproducible, and bounded.*

## Multiple Fronts

Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics expands how we measure and reason about systems.  
By pairing magnitude **m** with alignment **a**, symbolic numerals turn scalars into richer, reproducible descriptors.

- **Diagnostics:** detect hidden drift, anticipate instability, and surface early warnings.
- **Prescriptives:** optimize for resilience by balancing strength **S = m × a**, not fragile peaks.
- **Transitions:** reframe phase-like changes as alignment-conditioned paths, backed by data.
- **Extensions:** give structured meaning to edge cases (incl. infinities) under clear rules.

**Universality.** The method is mathematics-first and domain-agnostic; collapse φ(m, a) = m preserves classical results.

**Relation to other formalisms.** Compared with interval and fuzzy frameworks, SSM keeps exact collapse to ℝ and adds a bounded early-warning channel via **a**, with reproducible combination rules (M2).

**Outlook.** Ongoing work explores extending **a** toward linguistic/semantic alignment for interpretable, symbolic reasoning.

## Scope & Caution

**Scope**
- Mathematics-first; conservative extension of ℝ.
- Observation-grade; not an operational system.
- Reproducible; plain-text formulas and fixed rules.
- Domain-agnostic; same rules across datasets.

**Caution**
- Research release; needs broader peer review.
- Benchmarks are observation-only.
- No guarantees for clinical or safety-critical use.
- Results should be replicated before adoption.
